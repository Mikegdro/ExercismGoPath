# ExercismGoPath
This repository is for the Go learning Path of [exercism.org](https://exercism.org)

I really recommend using exercism, it is totally free, doesn't require much work, and it is amazing to start learning a new language from scratch without much problems.

I have personally chosen to use the learning path at first, to really get a grasp at the core concepts of Golang.

I've installed the CLI to develop every exercise to github and have a record of my progress, this was a very straight up process, just unpacking a tar and adding the executable to the Path.

I'm going to divide it in modules, to keep it organized, starting with M0, which will be the main introduction to the Golang language.
